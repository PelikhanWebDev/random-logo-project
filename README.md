# Random Logo Project
RLP helps you come up with fun ideas for honing your logo design skills and get your creative juices flowing. It will provide you with two different random keywords that will be the starting point for your logo project.

Just go to https://pelikhanwebdev.github.io/random-logo-project/ and create a logo or logotype based on the first two keywords you see. It's as easy as that. Refreshing = Cheating!
